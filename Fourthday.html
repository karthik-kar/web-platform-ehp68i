<h1>Day4</h1>
<p>Today in the morning we went for fishing, But suddenly we saw a lion , we are very much scared , Lion started attacking us , Sunny shouted in fear , Vicky attacked the lion from back and killed the lion, Bhuvia told this is very dangerous we have to leave immediately, so we started running , suddenly we saw an anaconda in the way luckily it was dead, forest officers found us we felt so happy and i went to my house , it was very scary experience for us kids , but we did a great job, Thank god.</p>
